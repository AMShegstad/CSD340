            <p> A lifelong enjoyer of all things tech, I started coding simply out of curiosity about how my favorite video games
                were made. Since then, I've had my own bit of fun with c++ in the past few years, and now am working towards my 
                bachelor's degree in Software Development. I also plan to attend a 24 week wev development bootcamp at the University of Minnesota
                after graduation, in order to dive head first into some of the popular libraries and tools that are popular in today's
                professional settings.

            <P>
                I've worked for Target for more than sixteen years at the time of writing, and it is through their partnership with 
                Guild Education that I am going to school debt-free. While I am excited to gain my education and move to a new career
                and lifelong learning experience, I would very much like to stay with my company. Having been a user of the company's 
                internally developed software for many years, I'd like to bring my first-hand experience in multiple areas of operation
                at the store level to bring improvements to those tools.
            </P>
